# Netyzer

Netyzer (Network Analyzer) is an open source project created for educational purposes.

My curiosity and my dual need to learn more about both computer networking and the C language led me to develop Netyzer as a way to put what I was learning into practice.

Netyzer was not born as a tool to be integrated into production environments. However, if the future allows it, I will make it an alternative to well-known projects like Wireshark.

## Why Netyzer

In fact, Netyzer will offer itself as a tool conceptually:

- Lightweight and multi-platform;
- Integrable in existing pipelines;
- Fast and customizable.

## Roadmap

This is the roadmap I have in mind:

1. packet visualization
2. package analysis
3. search for specific packets
4. saving packets to a file
5. implement filters to capture specific packets

## Please, note that...

Netyzer is a project that started as a self-study, and only later could it offer itself as a real productive tool (I would love to, but that is not the primary goal).

So the code may not be of high quality. It may contain bugs and errors. It may be inelegant, and striving for clean code is one of my goals. 

However, it is a completely open source project and welcomes outside contributions and suggestions :)
